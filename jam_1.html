</head><body><h1>##Guitar @ Libera.Chat Jam Sessions</h1>

<hr>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>They are virtual non-real-time jam sessions, in which players will take =
turns showing off their latest musical skills on their choice of instrument=
 to a selected backing track. The idea is free to evolve or be reinterprete=
d.

</p><h2>How will it work?</h2>

<p>Each session has one coordinator and multiple submitters. The coordinato=
r can also submit. The coordinator distributes the same short backing track=
 to each submitter. The submitter records a single track (or maybe 2 if ste=
reo is your thing?) against the backing track. The submitter=E2=80=99s subm=
ission does NOT include the backing track, only the recording of the instru=
ment (and any processing they=E2=80=99d like). The coordinator then collect=
s these takes and arranges them one after another, placing each on top of t=
he original backing track.

</p><p>The submitter should strive to submit a WAV file. The length of the =
submission should be approximately the same length as the back tract (perha=
ps include the leading clicks so I have something to align the timing with!=
). However, a trailing second or two is admissible, but note that those fin=
al seconds will be quickly faded in the mix. The submitter is responsible f=
or baking in any processing that they believe is needed to make their recor=
ding sound correct when mixed with the original backing track.

</p><p>The coordinator will have the choice of any additional processing of=
 the backing track or the submitted takes when mixing. Modification of subm=
itted tracks by the coordinator should be minimal and only for the purpose =
of benefiting the mix. Optionally, based on agreement among coordinator and=
 participants, the coordinator could make takes available to participants (=
e.g., for a remix).

</p><h2>Backing track</h2>

<p>I created a simple brief backing track. It's less than 40 seconds--part =
of the challenge is making your statement quickly! It's a 12-bar blues styl=
e. Thank you to Mike Holstein for submitting a bass guitar track that liven=
ed this one up!

</p><p>The tempo is 80 bpm. The guitars are playing in the key of A. The rh=
ythm guitars follow a progression like this:

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>A5</td><td>A5</td><td>A5</td><td>A5
</td></tr><tr><td>D5</td><td>D5</td><td>A5</td><td>A5
</td></tr><tr><td>E5</td><td>D5</td><td>A5</td><td>E5
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>The backing track is available in two formats:=20

<a href=3D"https://doogan.us/nj/duel/duel_1.wav">WAV</a>, <a href=3D"https:=
//doogan.us/nj/duel/duel_1.mp3">MP3</a>

</p><h2>Submission details</h2>

<p>I aim to have all the submissions collected by the end of November 7, 20=
21. But I'd prefer getting more submissions than being on time. So please r=
each out if you want to submit but can't make the hopeful deadline. I won't=
 know you want to submit after the deadline unless you tell me.

</p><p>Make your submission by sending me (fendur) a private message on Lib=
era.chat with a link to your sound file. I prefer WAV files, but submit wha=
t you can and I'll work with it.

</p><p>Please reach out to your peers (me included) if you need help with s=
omething. Whether it's the musical style, software, recording, or whatever,=
 the goal is to get a community product together for everyone to enjoy whil=
e learning something.

</p><h2>Result</h2>

<p>The final result will be linked here. It will be in the form of one long=
 audio file mixed by the coordinator.

</p><p>[2021.11.08 10:30a EST] Update: Most subissions are in and a draft m=
ix is worked up and it sounds so damn cool. However, so everyone has a chan=
ce to be fully included in any discussion following release, I don't want t=
o drop it until it's completely finished. I expect this will be no later th=
an 2021.11.13. Thanks for your patience.
